Determining the age of volcanic rocks helps scientists understand Earth's geological history and volcanic activity. This study examines two common techniques used for geochemical analysis: Electron Microprobe Analysis (EPMA) and Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). These methods provide data that can be used to train artificial intelligence (AI) models for estimating rock ages. However, not all data sources are equally reliable, and errors in data collection can affect AI model accuracy.
In this research, we tested volcanic rock samples using both EPMA and LA-ICP-MS and analyzed the results with machine learning techniques. Our findings show that LA-ICP-MS provides more consistent and accurate geochemical data, resulting in AI models that predict rock ages with 95% accuracy. In contrast, EPMA data led to lower accuracy due to inconsistencies in trace element detection.
These results suggest that high-quality data sources improve AI predictions and can enhance the reliability of automated geochronology. Understanding volcanic rock ages more precisely can help scientists refine geological timelines, assess volcanic hazards, and improve models of Earth's evolution. This study demonstrates the value of AI and advanced geochemical techniques in improving rock dating methods.
